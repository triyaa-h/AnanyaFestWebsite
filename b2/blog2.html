        <p><b>KSIT recently hosted its much-anticipated annual event, Jersey Day, and it was nothing short of spectacular! This vibrant celebration brought together students, faculty, and staff in a colorful and spirited display of school pride and camaraderie.

            Jersey Day is all about showcasing our love for sports and the values they representâ€”dedication, perseverance, and teamwork. Participants donned jerseys of their favorite sports teams and athletes, transforming the campus into a lively sea of colors and enthusiasm. The event wasn't just about wearing jerseys; it was a celebration of the collective spirit that sports inspire.
            
            The day was filled with a variety of engaging activities and competitions. Friendly matches in soccer, basketball, and volleyball saw teams from different departments battling it out on the field with great energy and sportsmanship. Spectators cheered for their peers, creating an electric atmosphere of support and excitement.
